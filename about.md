# About

Hello! My name is Goh Yong Liang; Yong Liang is my first name, and Goh is my last name. Typical Asian name structure is such that it follows the format of Last-Name, First-Name. I am born in Singapore and have lived here all my life thus far.

I am lucky enough to be pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg) (NUS) through a joint industrial programme together with [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/). 

Prior to this, I graduated from NUS with a B.Eng in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Control Engineering, in 2015. Following that, I spent a year and a half at [HP Inc. Singapore](https://www.hp.com) as a Data Scientist working on manufacturing problems. After which, I joined [Allianz](https://www.allianz.com) for two years as a Senior Data Scientist, working on a myriad of problems in insurance Data Science across multiple South-east Asian countries.
